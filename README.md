# MetaMask-Snap
MetaMask Snaps is a feature of the MetaMask wallet that enables developers to build and integrate custom plugins, known as "snaps," which enhance the wallet's functionality. These snaps allow for personalized features, additional blockchain interactions, and custom user interfaces while maintaining a secure environment.

  - [Create a Snap to estimate gas fees](#create-a-snap-to-estimate-gas-fees) 

## Features

- Creating a Snap that calculates the percentage of gas fees they would pay for their transaction.
- Creating a Snap that estimates gas fees. The Snap uses the fetch API to request information from the internet, and displays IN  MetaMask's transaction confirmation window.


## Prerequisites
- InstallÂ [MetaMask Flask](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/)
- You can use Infura's Sepolia faucet to get Sepolia ETH.
- A text editor (for example, VS Code)
- Node version 20.11 or later
- Yarn

Note: Install Flask in a new browser profile, or disable any existing installed versions of MetaMask before installing Flask. Running multiple instances of MetaMask in the same browser profile can break dapp interactions.
