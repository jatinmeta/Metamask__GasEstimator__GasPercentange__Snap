# MetaMask-Snap
MetaMask Snaps is a feature of the MetaMask wallet that enables developers to build and integrate custom plugins, known as "snaps," which enhance the wallet's functionality. These snaps allow for personalized features, additional blockchain interactions, and custom user interfaces while maintaining a secure environment. This modular approach encourages innovation within the MetaMask ecosystem, allowing users to tailor their wallet experience to their specific needs.

### MetaMask Flask setup

- Install [MetaMask Flask](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/)

Note: Install Flask in a new browser profile, or disable any existing installed versions of MetaMask before installing Flask. Running multiple instances of MetaMask in the same browser profile can break dapp interactions.
